Introducing the *Message Format* library - a powerful and easy-to-use Java API for formatting
messages and exceptions. With this library, developers can easily create messages that have
placeholders for values, which are automatically formatted based on their types. The library
includes formatters for most common Java types, and custom formatters can be easily developed and
added.

One of the key features of this library is its support for templates, which are messages that can
be embedded in other messages. This makes it easy for developers to reuse messages throughout their
application, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. They can also export and import messages
and templates, making it easy to share them between projects or even between teams.

In addition, the *Message Format* library supports localized messages, so developers can create
messages in multiple languages and easily switch between them.

To make it even easier to use, a Gradle plugin is available that packs all messages in a single
file, which can be imported into the application. With this plugin, developers can keep their
messages organized and easily maintainable, while still taking advantage of all the power and
flexibility of the *Message Format* library.

Overall, the *Message Format* library is a must-have tool for any Java developer who wants to
create clear, concise, and easily maintainable messages and exceptions. Give it a try today and
experience the difference it can make in your projects!
