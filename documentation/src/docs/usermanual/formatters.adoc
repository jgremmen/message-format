:navtitle: Formatters

The *Message Format* library includes a vast array of pre-defined parameter formatters that can be
used right away. Developers can learn how to utilize and configure each formatter to cater to their
specific requirements in this section.

There are 2 types of parameter formatters:

* named formatters are selected by providing the formatter name
* typed formatters are selected based on the types they are capable of formatting and the type hierarchy
  of the value to be formatted

How formatters are selected based on the value to be formatted and the optional formatter name is explained
in a separate xref:formatters_selection.adoc[chapter].
