:navtitle: Formatters

The message format library comes with a large number of pre-defined parameter formatters.
In this section you'll learn how to use and configure each formatter to meet your individual needs.

There are 2 types of parameter formatters:

* named formatters are selected by providing the formatter name
* typed formatters are selected based on the types they are capable of formatting and the type hierarchy
  of the value to be formatted

How formatters are selected based on the value to be formatted and the optional formatter name is explained
in a separate xref:formatters_selection.adoc[chapter].
